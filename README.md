processor scheduling simulator that
1-distribute process load across processers
2-set processers algorithims FSFS,SJF,RR
3-deal with user input and output process such as user entering data so the process is put in waiting list
4-preform migration between different processors to balance work load and processors utilization across processors
5-preform process killing on user's order such killing a process by task manager
6-fork process to each others so processors can deal with process related to each other
this project is made using custom datastractures to optimize all algorithims and give the best preformance
